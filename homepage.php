            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                To fulfill the needs of the Asian people for the safest, most reliable and most cost-effective
                blood services through voluntary donations.The Blood Bank empowers ordinary people to perform 
                extraordinary acts of service. Our blood donors are ordinary people – high school students, factory
                 and office workers, business executives, parents and grandparents, and people from every walk of life. 
                 But they share one thing – a generous spirit, a desire to give back to their community and help others. 
                 Blood donors play an integral role in the delivery of modern healthcare. Many life-saving medical 
                 treatments and procedures involve blood transfusions and would not be possible without a safe and reliable 
                 blood supply.
            </p>

                <strong>Every two seconds someone receives a unit of blood. The need is constant. It is our mission 
                to meet that need.</strong>
